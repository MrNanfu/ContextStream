Video recordings of user activities, particularly desktop recordings, offer a rich source of data for understanding user behaviors and automating processes. However, despite advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their increasing use in video analysis, extracting user actions from desktop recordings remains an underexplored area. This paper addresses this gap by proposing two novel VLM-based methods for user action extraction: the Direct Frame-Based Approach (DF), which inputs sampled frames directly into VLMs, and the Differential Frame-Based Approach (DiffF), which incorporates explicit frame differences detected via computer vision techniques. We evaluate these methods using a basic self-curated dataset and an advanced benchmark adapted from prior work. Our results show that the DF approach achieves an accuracy of 70\% to 80\% in identifying user actions, with the extracted action sequences being re-playable though Robotic Process Automation. We find that while VLMs show potential, incorporating explicit UI changes can degrade performance, making the DF approach more reliable. This work represents the first application of VLMs for extracting user action sequences from desktop recordings, contributing new methods, benchmarks, and insights for future research.

## Key Contributions
1. We introduce two VLM-based methods to address the gap in existing research on extracting user action sequences from desktop recordings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to leverage VLMs for this task.

2. We develop two benchmark datasets to assess the perfor-
mance of methods on this task. All evaluation source codes
and benchmarks will be made publicly available.

3. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed
methods using the developed benchmarks.

<!-- ## Table: Comparison of Computable and Non-Computable Numbers

| Computable Numbers | Non-Computable Numbers |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Rational numbers, e.g., 1/2, 3/4 | Transcendental numbers, e.g., π, e |
| Algebraic numbers, e.g., √2, ∛3 | Non-algebraic numbers, e.g., √2 + √3 |
| Numbers with finite decimal representations | Numbers with infinite, non-repeating decimal representations |

He used the concept of a universal Turing machine to prove that the set of computable functions is recursively enumerable, meaning it can be listed by an algorithm. -->

## Significance
Turing's paper laid the foundation for the theory of computation and had a profound impact on the development of computer science. The Turing machine became a fundamental concept in theoretical computer science, serving as a theoretical model for studying the limits and capabilities of computation. Turing's work also influenced the development of programming languages, algorithms, and the design of modern computers. -->
